This repository has the instructions on how to run analysis as instructed in the Course Project

Dataset
Download and Unzip the Dataset from the given URL and import data from the UCI HAR Dataset onto R

Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed on the data
run_analysis.R performs the data cleaning and also performs the 5 steps as described in the course project

a. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
b. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
c. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
d. Appropriately labelling the data set with descriptive variable names
e. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

TidyData.txt is the exported final data
